Adds a prisoner-interaction to release prisoner only when healthy.
When they get healthy the interaction is automatically set to Release.

There is also an option to make this the default interaction on all new prisoners, excluding quest-pawns.

[strike]If you like this one, take a look at my other prisoner interaction-mods
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2702584632]Convert Then Recruit[/url],
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2838846353]Convert Then Release[/url]
and
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2705395014]Convert Then Enslave[/url]
[/strike]

So I've previously made some different prisoner interraction-mods and since the total number of different options started getting out of hand I combined them into a new mod, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2841231775]Custom Prisoner Interactions[/url]
This mod will still stay around for those who want it but the new mod has the same features as all the others combined plus some improvements.
