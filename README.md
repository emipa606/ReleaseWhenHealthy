Adds a prisoner-interaction to release prisoner only when healthy.
When they get healthy the interaction is automatically set to Release.

There is also an option to make this the default interaction on all new prisoners, excluding quest-pawns.

Japanese translation from https://rimworld.2game.info/detail.php?id=2506029522]RimWorld Mod database

[strike]If you like this one, take a look at my other prisoner interaction-mods
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2702584632]Convert Then Recruit,
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2838846353]Convert Then Release
and
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2705395014]Convert Then Enslave
[/strike]

So I've previously made some different prisoner interraction-mods and since the total number of different options started getting out of hand I combined them into a new mod, https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2841231775]Custom Prisoner Interactions
This mod will still stay around for those who want it but the new mod has the same features as all the others combined plus some improvements.
